## üèãÔ∏è Introduction

**GymPoseAI** is a smart at-home fitness application designed to enhance your workout effectiveness using artificial intelligence (AI). The app is compatible with both **iOS** and **Android** devices and analyzes user posture via camera, offering real-time feedback.

> üìå The goal of this project is to provide a platform that helps users train with proper form, easily track their progress, and achieve optimal results from home.

> üì∑ **Note**: The camera system is a **dedicated external hardware setup**, consisting of a **Raspberry Pi 4** and **a speaker** that functions as the primary image capturing and real-time voice feedback unit.
